# SB1-2zfIl3

## Project Overview

This project is a TypeScript-based React web application built using the Vite build tool. It includes a user interface showcasing a music player for a track titled "El Choclo" by √Ångel Villoldo. The application has been set up to run on StackBlitz for easy editing and previewing.

## Features

- **React with TypeScript:** The application is built with React and TypeScript, providing a strong type-checking environment.
- **Vite for Development:** Fast and efficient bundling and development server provided by Vite.
- **Music Player UI:** A simple music player UI displaying the track name, artist, and controls to play or pause the track.
- **TailwindCSS Integration:** Styled using TailwindCSS for modern and responsive design.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **npm** are required to run the development server locally.
- **Vite** is used as the dev server, which can be set up using `npm install`.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IgnatMaldive/sb1-2zfIl3.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project directory:**

   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
